# Data-Engineering---Youtube-Data-Analysis-AWS
In this project, we will analyse youtube videos database for a marketing purpose. In order to allow our customers to make the choice on which YT video should I choose to put my ad campaign on and so on and so forth.

The requirements from our customers:
  - Launching new data-driven campaign.
  - Main advertising channel : Youtube Ads.
  - Initial questions to answer:
    - How to categorise Youtube videos, based on their comments and statistics (views, channels subsribers ...) ?
    - What factors affect how popular a YT video will be ?

Why choosing Youtube as a channel Campaign.
  Because it's the second most-visited website in the world. 34.6 billion visitors per month.
